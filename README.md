# Btbuddyshare

This is a work in progress. 

Whats BTBuddyShare? 

BTbuddyshare is aiming to integrate the great application BitTorrentSync to help
you and your buddys too share movie-lists and tv-lists to see if your friend is watching
something you might want. Taking the greate Bittorrentsync application to help you send 
databasfiles with secure connection and making it safe for you to move around files over 
the internet. 

What the aim with this projekt?

I'm not aiming to help people too spread pirated files but how you use this software is
up to you. 

The program is shit?!

The program is still in a very early stages, and the coding is still pritty crappy.

If you got any python and coding skills and want to help this projekt along. Please feel free to 
contact me. This is open-source and anyone can help me develop this program.

Who am I?

I'm not a Gread A programmer, and I'm doing this projekt too learn how to become a better programmer.
All on spare time.
